This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `removeIf` function when used with `MutableList` in Kotlin. The `bug.kt` file showcases the problem, where removing elements based on a condition leads to unexpected list modification. The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a solution illustrating safer ways to handle such modifications, avoiding potential errors and improving code predictability.  The core issue is that `removeIf` modifies the list directly; under certain circumstances this can lead to unexpected consequences if the iteration order is not carefully considered.
